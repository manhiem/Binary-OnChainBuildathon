This game redefines social gaming, offering dynamic engagement and endless opportunities within a decentralized framework.

## Inspiration
The web3 ecosystem envisions a world powered by decentralized technologies, yet these remain complex for the average user. With 01 Realm, we aim to make the decentralized gaming experience accessible and engaging. Our inspiration stemmed from the desire to transform social interactions and gaming by creating a 3D universe where players can connect, compete, and explore using unique NFT characters. We wanted to break away from the traditional social media experience and offer a vibrant, interactive alternative that leverages the power of blockchain technology.
